# Data file for OBDefinable class.
# A # in the first column or a # followed by whitespace introduces a comment and
#   the rest of the characters on a line are ignored.
# White space is trimmed from the front and back of the line.
#   
# There can be any number of lines containing only whitespace and 
#   comment between objects, but none within an object.
# Lines which have "\n" at the end have this replaced by a new line
#   character and the next line is concatenated.
