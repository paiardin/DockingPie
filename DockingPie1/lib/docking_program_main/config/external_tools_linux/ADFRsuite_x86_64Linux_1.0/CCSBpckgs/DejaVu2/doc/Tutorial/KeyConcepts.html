This document reviews a few of the basic concepts of the DejaVu package.
<h2>
<a NAME="Viewer Class"></a>1 - The Viewer Class</h2>
The Viewer-object is probably the most "sophisticated" object in DejaVu.
In fact it is a fully functional visualization application providing control
over a&nbsp; fair number of rendering parameters such as, depth cueing,
rendering modes (points, lines, polygons), shading modes (flat, gouraud),
multiple light sources, arbitrary clipping planes etc, geometris to visualize
can be handed to a viewer object to be displayed and transformed. The Viewer-object
also has default mouse bindings for the trackball object which allow the
user not only to rotate, translate, or scale the scene, or individual geometries,
but also to rotate and translate the camera position (i.e. the viewer's
position), the positions of the light sources, or the positions of the
clipping planes. The "<a href="#Mouse Binding">mouse binding buttons</a>"
in the GUI&nbsp; bind the mouse to the current object, camera, or light
actually transformed when mouse motion generates 3D transformations.
<br>DejaVu was built around the idea that one should be able to instantiate
a viewer and hand it objects that would actually know how to render themselves.
All geometry classes included in DejaVu (polygon, polylines, spheres, labels
etc...) inherit from the Geom base class and implement their own displayFunction
method that gets called by the Viewer each time the object has to be drawn.
This means that anyone can create objects that suitable to be passed to
a Viewer instance (as long as they inherit from the Geom class).
<br>Being heavily influenced by the AVS (Advanced Visualization System)
architecture (as well as by my numerous previous viewing programs) I decided
that geometries inside a Viewer would build a tree-like structure in which
3D transformations (rotation, translation, scale) are inherited by children
objects. I also played with the idea of inheritance of rendering properties,
even though that is only partially implemented.
<h2>
<a NAME="Current"></a>2 - Current object, camera, light, clipping plane:</h2>
As people started to use the Viewer (initially only made of a Camera),
they quickly requested a GUI that would let them modify properties of the
objects in the Viewer at the click of a button. This was done in a quick
and dirty way (creating all kinds of problems!). Anyway, since the GUI
allows modifications of the properties of the geometries, cameras, light
sources and clipping planes, the Viewer has to have a&nbsp; <a href="#Current Object">current-object</a>,
<a href="#Current Camera">current-camera</a>,
<a href="#Current Light">current-light</a>, and <a href="#Current clipping">current
clipping-plane </a>which will undergo the changes initialed using the GUI.
Pointers to the current items (object, camera, clipping plane and light)
are available as members of the viewer object.
<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="Current Object"></a>Current object:</h3>
The current-object can be selected in the GUI by right-clicking on its
name in the object listbox. Another way to select an geometry (i.e. an
object) is to right click on its geometry. The name of the current object
is highlighted in the GUI. The viewer instance also has a member called
currentObject pointing to that object. This handle can be used to set the
current-object programmatically.&nbsp; To select the root object, click
on the background.
<h3>
<a NAME="Current Camera"></a>Current camera:</h3>
This concept is only meaningful when multiple cameras are used, else the
default camera is always the current one. The current-camera is the one
that has a red outline. To select a camera to be the current one, right-click
on its background. NOTE: right-clicking on the background of the current
camera means something different: it means make the root object the current
object.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Current clipping"></a>Current clipping plane:</h3>
The Viewer supports <a href="#clipping plane property">arbitrary clipping
planes.</a> Their number depends on your OpenGL implementation.&nbsp; Clipping
planes are activated on a per-object basis. They can be inherited by children,
i.e. turning on the first clipping plane while Object A is the current
object will activate this clipping plane for Object A <u>only.</u>&nbsp;
The current clipping plane can be selected either using the <a href="#clipping plane property">clipping
plane property panel</a> in the GUI or by right-clicking on the geometry
representing a clipping plane in a&nbsp; camera (if it is visible). The
current clipping plane can be determined by looking at the <a href="#clipping plane property">clipping
plane property panel</a> or by examining the Viewer's member called currentClip
that points to that clipping plane.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Current Light"></a>Current light:</h3>
An instance of a viewer contains a <a href="#light property">light-model
object</a> that provides an interface to the OpenGL Lighting Model.&nbsp;
It also maintains a list of independent light source objects. Currently
only directional light-sources are supported.&nbsp; The current-light can
be selected either using the <a href="#light property">light property panel</a>
in the GUI or by right-clicking on the geometry representing a light source
(if it is visible). The current light can be determined by looking at the
<a href="#light property">light
property panel</a> or by examining the Viewer's member called currentLight
that points to that light source object.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="Transformations and inheritance:"></a>3 - Transformations, Inheritance
and Root Object:</h2>
As I said before, the geometries are organized in a tree-like structure.
There is a special object called the Root Object which is always present,
cannot be deleted and is the parent of all other geometries in the viewer.
Every node in that tree (i.e. every geometry) stores its own transformations
(i.e. rotation, translation, scale, pivot point). It is important to understand
that the transformations assigned to a given node are applied to all the
children of that node. This is called the transformation inheritance. Since
every geometry in the scene has to be a descendant of the 'root' object,
root becomes naturally a place holder for the "world's transformation".
In other words, applying a rotation to the root object is the same as rotating
the whole scene.
<br>By default, mouse click-and-drag actions will generate 3D transformations
(<a href="KeyConcepts.html#Mouse Binding">see Mouse Default Bindings</a>
). These transformations are always applied to the current object (that
is if the trackball is currently bound to transform geometries see "<a href="#Mouse Binding">mouse
binding buttons</a>"). By selecting another object than root you can alter
this object's transformation. When doing this, sibling nodes of the currently
selected one are NOT transformed. Finally, right below the <a href="#List Object">object
list box</a> you can see a group of three buttons called reset, normalize
and center. These buttons always apply to the current object and have the
following functions:
<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="Reset:"></a>Reset:</h3>
This button resets the transformation of the current object. Its rotation
becomes identity, its translation the vector (0.,0.,0.) and its scale the
vector (1.,1.,1.). Nothing changes for parent nodes of children, they all
keep their own transformations untouched.
<h3>
<a NAME="Normalize:"></a>Normalize:</h3>
I would advise using this only on the root object. However, applied to
another currentObject, this is what should happen. This function translates
and scales the bounding box of the geometries in the sub tree rooted at
the current object in such a way that the bounding box roughly fills the
Camera. When applied to root, this gives you a nice view of the whole scene.&nbsp;
When applied to another object in the scene, its bounding box should fill
the camera.
<h3>
<a NAME="Center:"></a>Center:</h3>
This button sets the center of rotation of the current object to the center
of gravity of all the vertices found in that geometry and all its children.
For instance, when applied to the root it sets the center of rotation of
the "world" to be the center of gravity of the scene.</blockquote>

<h3>

Transformations with the Mouse</h3>

<p>Because of the perspective, the Z-translation looks like a scaling operation,
but it is not. You can tell
<br>the difference by doing a Z-translation away from you. You will see
the object fade in the fog ...!
<p>You can set the rotation center of the current object by picking on
any vertex in the scene while
<br>holding down the Shift key.

<h2>
<a NAME="GUI"></a>5 - GUI overview:</h2>
<img SRC="./images/arcViGUI.jpg" align=TEXTTOP>
<br>&nbsp;First of all the GUI shown here is optional. A Viewer can be
instantiated without a GUI and its cameras can actually even be embedded
inside other Tk widgets. The Default GUI is essentially separated in 3
parts: the mouse binding buttons at he top, the object list box in the
center and the property panels at the bottom.
<ol>
<h3>
<a NAME="Mouse Binding"></a>Mouse Binding Buttons:</h3>
The GUI presents a row of buttons under <i>Transform </i>which allow the
user to direct transformations to the current Object, the current Camera,
the current Clipping plane, the current Light or the current Texture. Normally&nbsp;
"<i>Object</i>" is selected (I call transformation a rotation, translation
or scale operation). This means that the callback functions of the camera's
trackball are bound to the functions transforming the current object's
position. Some of these functions can also be achieved by clicking actions
inside Cameras.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="List Object"></a>Object List Box:</h3>
This widget shows the tree-like structure of geometries present in a Viewer.
Children are indented using the a number of '~' symbols showing their distance
to the root object. The '~' symbol is not part of the object's name. Names
have to be unique and if a same name is given to two different geometries,
the Viewer will concatenate a '.x' where x is an integer to the object
name to make the name unique.
<br>When an object is added to a Viewer its parent can be specified. If
omitted, 'root' is assumed to be the parent.
<h3>
<a NAME="Property"></a>Property panels:</h3>
There is a property panel for the current object, camera as well as for
clipping planes and light sources. Only one of these panels is visible
at a time. The one shown is selected using the buttons in the "Properties
Panel Menu" box.
<h4>
<a NAME="Object property"></a>Object property panel</h4>
<img SRC="annObj_PropPanel.jpg" height=386 width=556 align=TEXTTOP>
<p>The drawing mode menu for front-facing polygons lets you choose inherit,
in which case the polygons are drawn in the same mode as their parent,
or as points, lines or with a filled representation.&nbsp; There may also
be an outline mode which appears only if your OpenGL provides the OffsetPolygon
extension.
<br><img SRC="frontMenu.jpg" height=94 width=100 align=TEXTTOP>
<p>The drawing mode menu for back-facing polygons adds the possibility
of the back polygons being represented with the same mode selected for
the front.
<br><img SRC="backMenu.jpg" height=118 width=102 align=TEXTTOP>
<p>The shading mode menu selections are for the current object to be shaded
with an inherited shading mode, with flat shading which shades the entire
polygon with one color, with smooth shading which uses gourot shading or
not at all.
<br><img SRC="shadeMenu.jpg" height=97 width=107 align=TEXTTOP>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The culling mode menu selections are to select which polygons to be
culled in the same mode as in the current object's parent, to do no culling,
to cull the back-facing polygons, to cull the front-facing polygons or
to cull all of them (which makes the object disappear!)
<br><img SRC="cullingMenu.jpg" height=119 width=174 align=TEXTTOP>
<h4>
<a NAME="camera property"></a>Camera property panel</h4>
<img SRC="annCam_PropPanel.jpg" height=315 width=592 align=TEXTTOP>
<p><font color="#CC33CC">(1)</font> The bounding box of the current object
by default is not shown.&nbsp; You can use this menu to show the bounding
box alone or with the current object.&nbsp; This bounding box has the special
property that it remains orthogonal to the axes of the viewer even if the
object it bounds is rotated.&nbsp; If the current object is root, the bounding
box encompasses all of the objects in the scene.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(2)</font> In auto spin mode the object continues
its motion after the mouse button has been released.&nbsp; This motion
continues until the next mouse button click.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(3)</font> Scene antialiasing uses the standard
OpenGl scene jittering to achieve antialiasing.&nbsp; You can select how
much jittering is done from these values: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 24 and 66.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(4) </font>This displays the color editor which
allows you to modify the background color of the current camera.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(5)</font> The line represents the z-axis with
the Viewer at the left and infinity at the right. The triangles may be
dragged any where in this range. The left blue triangle on the top of the
line sets the position of the near clipping plane while the top right blue
triangle sets the position of the far clipping plane.&nbsp; By changing
the positions of these two triangles, you can display selected sections
along the z-axis.&nbsp; The bottom left triangle represents the plane along
the z-axis where fog starts and the bottom right triangle the plane for
100% fog.&nbsp; Linear fog is implemented between these two.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="clipping plane property"></a>Clipping plane property panel</h4>
<img SRC="annClip_PropPanel.jpg" height=332 width=574 align=TEXTTOP>
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(1) </font>The number of lights&nbsp; depends
on your OpenGL implementation.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(2)&nbsp; </font>The on button lets the user
turn on or off the current clipping plane on a per object basis.&nbsp;
If it is on, the current plane will clip the current object, hiding one
side.&nbsp; The side button lets you toggle which side of the current object,
as divided by the current clipping plane, is hidden.&nbsp; The inh button
sets whether the children of the current object will inherit the type of
clipping performed by the current clipping plane.&nbsp; The disp button
lets you toggle whether the current clipping plane is displayed in the
scene.&nbsp; The radiobuttons under current let you select the current
clipping plane.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="light property"></a>Light property panel</h4>
<img SRC="annLight_PropPanel.jpg" height=327 width=593 align=TEXTTOP>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#CC33CC">(1)</font> The default OpenGL Lighting Model (see
<u>OpenGL Programming Guide</u> ,M. Woo, J. Neider and T. Davis, Reading,
MA: Addison-Wesley Developers Press,&nbsp; 1997. pages 193-195) is based
on three concepts: global ambient light, whether the viewpoint position
is local to the scene or infinite distance away and whether lighting calculations
should be done differently for front and back faces of objects.&nbsp; The
default ambient light can be changed with the color editor. The location
of the viewpoint affects how the highlights on objects are calculated.&nbsp;
The Viewer uses the infinite distance viewpoint by default&nbsp; but this
can be changed to use a local viewer. The Viewer uses front face lighting
calculations as the default.&nbsp; It is slower to calculate lighting for
both sides of the polygons, but this may be useful in special cases.
<br><font color="#CC33CC">(2)</font> These buttons allow the selection
of the current light.&nbsp; Currently only directional light sources are
supported.&nbsp; The bottom three buttons always apply to the currently
selected light. The Light On button toggles the light on and off.&nbsp;
Show Lights button toggles whether a line is drawn in the Camera showing
the direction of the current light. Edit Light Color displays a color editor
which can be used to change the color of the current light.</ol>
