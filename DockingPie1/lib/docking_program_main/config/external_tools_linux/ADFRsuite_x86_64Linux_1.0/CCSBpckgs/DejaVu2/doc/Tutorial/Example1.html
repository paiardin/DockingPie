<h3>
<a NAME="SimpleExample"></a>Example 1: Getting started</h3>
In the following we will assume that you have are running Python1.5.2 and
that you can import OpenGL (which implies Tkinter), the Numeric extension
and also DejaVu, the viewer module itself. The word xxx-"object" refers
to an instance of the class xxx.&nbsp; For the code for this example, see
<a href="Example1.py">Example1.py.</a>
<p>Let's first import the viewer module from the DejaVu application
<pre>>>> from DejaVu import Viewer</pre>
All right, so let's instantiate our first viewer:
<pre>>>> MyViewer = Viewer()</pre>
This command creates a viewer with a first camera (3D window) that was
created with double buffering and a z-buffer by default. A viewer can have
several cameras allowing the user to look at the scene from several view
points.
<br>It is a good idea to use a non trivial name for the viewer (not v since
you are very likely to use v to refer to a list of vertices in which case
you would loose the handle to your viewer). Of course you can use a simpler
alias if you do not want to type in the viewer's whole name:
<pre>>>> v1 = MyViewer</pre>
After issuing this command you should have the following windows on your
screen:
<br>The viewer's GUI, and the first camera called camera 0.
<br><img SRC="GU.jpg" height=662 width=261 align=LEFT><img SRC="camera0.jpg" height=434 width=414 align=LEFT>
<br>The GUI presents a row of buttons under <i>Transform </i>which allow
the user to direct transformations to the current Object, the current Camera,
the current Clipping plane, the current Light or the current Texture. Normally&nbsp;
"<i>Object</i>" is selected (I call transformation a rotation, translation
or scale operation). This means that the callback functions of the camera's
trackball are bound to the functions transforming the current object's
position.
<br>Below this set of&nbsp; buttons we have the object list that currently
contains only one object called "<b><i>root</i></b>".&nbsp; <b>root</b>&nbsp;
is highlighted which means it is the current object. This "<b><i>root</i></b>"
object is protected against deletion and is a place holder for the world
transformation. All objects added to this viewer will be children of "<b><i>root</i></b>"
or one of its children and they all will inherit root's transformation
matrix. 3D transformation inheritance makes all children of the current
object undergo the same transformations as the current object.&nbsp; This
can be changed programmatically.(see Reference Manual)
<p>Now let's display a bunch of lines. To do this we need 3D coordinates:
<pre>>>> coords = [ [0.,0.,0.], [1.,1.,0.], [0.,1.,0.], [1.,0.,0.] ]</pre>
an array of indices telling which vertices are to be connected by lines:
<br>(each entry represents a line between two points whose indices in the
coords array are given)
<p><tt>>>> indices = [[0,1], [2,3],[0,2],[2,1],[1,3],[3,0]]</tt>
<p>Alternatively, the lines could be specified where each list represents
a line through the points whose indices are given. The value -1 terminates
the line. The first two entries draw the diagonals and the third the box
itself:
<pre>>>> indices = [[0,1, -1, 0,0], [2,3,-1,0,0], [0,2,1,3,0]]</pre>
and an optional array of materials. Here the tuples represent RGB values:
<pre>>>> materials = ( (1.,1.,1.,1.), (1.,0.,0.,1.), (0.,1.,0.,1.), (0.,0.,1.,1.) )</pre>
We create a geometry object of type IndexedPolylines:
<pre>>>> from DejaVu import IndexedPolylines</pre>

<pre>>>> cross = IndexedPolylines.IndexedPolylines('MyFirstObject')</pre>
We add the vertices, lines and materials to that object:
<pre>>>> cross.Set(vertices=coords, faces=indices, materials = materials )</pre>
and we add the geometry to the viewer:
<pre>>>> MyViewer.AddObject(cross)</pre>
to see the object, we need to redraw the scene:
<pre>>>> MyViewer.Redraw()</pre>

<pre><img SRC="example1b.jpg" height=451 width=430 align=LEFT></pre>
Now the object listbox should have one more line "<b><i>~MyFirstObject</i></b>".
The ~ is used to visualize the hierarchy. By default, AddObject makes the
new object the child of root.&nbsp; This can be changed programmatically
(see Reference Manual). In the camera you should see a square with four
vertices colored white, red, green and blue. You can use the mouse to transform
this object:
<br><a NAME="Mouse Default Bindings"></a>
<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFCCCC" NOSAVE >
<caption>Mouse default bindings</caption>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE>Middle-button</td>

<td>rotation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Right-button</td>

<td>XY-translation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shift + Middle-button</td>

<td>scale</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shift + Right-button</td>

<td>Z-translation</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Because of the perspective, the Z-translation looks like a scaling operation,
but it is not. You can tell the difference by doing a Z-translation away
from you. You will see the object fade in the fog ...!
<p>Now try to hit the <b><i>Reset </i></b>button in the GUI. The object
should return to its initial position. What you do here is to reset the
current object's transformation matrix.(See Reference Manual for more details.)
<p>If you hit the <b><i>Normalize </i></b>button, the square will be scaled
to fill out the camera. What happens here is that the bounding box of the
scene is computed and then the root object is transformed to fit the bounding
box into the camera.
<p>Notice that when you rotate, the square rotates about its lower left
corner (the white vertex). Try hitting the <b><i>Center </i></b>button
and do a rotation. The object now rotates about its center. What happens
here is that the center<b><i> </i></b>of the scene's bounding box is computed
and this point is set as the current object's rotation center. You can
<b><i>set
the rotation center</i></b> of the current object by picking on any vertex
in the scene while holding down the Shift key.
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFCCCC" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td>Shift + Left-button</td>

<td>set rotation center to picked vertex</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
The <b><i>Reset</i></b>, <b><i>Normalize </i></b>and <b><i>Center </i></b>functions
are also bound by default to the 'r', 'n' and 'c' keyboard keys (also to
the 'R', 'N' and 'C' keys).
<p>Up to now the current object was always the "<b><i>root</i></b>". Therefore,
all transformations were applied to "<b><i>root</i></b>" and the square
moved because it is a child of root and thus inherits its transformations.
<p>You can change the current object either by selecting its name in the
object list or by picking its graphical representation with the mouse in
the camera. Picking in the camera not on an object makes the root the current
object. (Also, an object can be made the current object programmatically
which is described in the Reference Manual.)
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="60%" BGCOLOR="#FFCCCC" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td>Left-button</td>

<td>selection picking</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
Using the left mouse button you can <b>select an object</b> (i.e. make
it the current object). Try picking on the square. If picking was successful,
the Object browser in the GUI should now highlight the object "<b><i>~cross</i></b>".
Any rotation, translation or scale operation will now apply to this object
and its children but won't affect its siblings.
<p>The Properties Panel appears below the Reset, Norm. and Center buttons.&nbsp;
This part of the GUI allows the user to interactively change the properties
of the current object, camera, any Clipping planes and any of the lights
present.&nbsp; Selecting Object, Camera, Clip or Light button causes the
appropriate submenu to be displayed at the bottom of the GUI.
<p>By default, the Object submenu is displayed. The Object submenu has
3 checkbuttons: Show Object lets you display or hide the current object,(
it has no effect if the current object is <b><i>root</i></b>) and the Edit
Object Material button lets you change the color, value and surface properties
of the current object.
<p>Set the current object to "~MyFirstObject" and toggle the Show Object
checkbutton.&nbsp; The box should appear and disappear in the Camera 0.
<p>Click on the Edit Object Material checkbutton.&nbsp; Controls are displayed
which allow you to change the color, value and other properties of the
materials used to display the current object, "~MyFirstObject."&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Example Two below shows you more about changing the materials of the current
object.)
<br>Click on this button again to close this portion of the GUI.&nbsp;
(It is not possible to change the properties of the root's materials)
<p>Next is the Delete Object button.&nbsp; If you press this button, the
current object will be deleted and removed from the viewer.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp;
The box should disappear from Camera 0. To restore it, you must again add
it to your viewer.
<p><tt>>>> MyViewer.AddObject(cross)</tt><tt></tt>
<p>to see the object, we need to redraw the scene:
<p><tt>>>> MyViewer.Redraw()</tt>
<p>The LineWidth and PointWidth Sliders allow you to change these properties
of the current object if it is possible.
<br>Make "~MyFirstObject" the current object and try dragging the small
blue triangle above the slider. You should see the line widths change in
Camera 0.
<p>The last four buttons allow you to make choices about how the Front
and Back views of the current object are displayed,&nbsp; what kind of
shading is used and what kind of culling is done on it.&nbsp; These are
illustrated with the third example below.
<p>Up to now we have transformed geometries, but you can also transform
the camera position or the clipping planes.
<br>Let's first name a <b>clipping plane</b>:
<br><i>NOTE:You must make ~MyFirstObject the current object by selecting
it in the ViewerGUI or by clicking and you should increase the size of
"cross" with Shift-Middle Mouse Button before starting this section.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>>>> cl = MyViewer.clipP[0]</pre>
This a handle to the first clipping plane. By default this plane has equation
x=0. The number of clipping planes available depends on your hardware.
The OpenGL specifications speak about 6 or more such planes. When a viewer
gets instantiated, it finds out how many such planes your OpenGL implementation
provides and creates an array of clipping planes for the viewer (<i>MyViewer.clipP</i>).
<p>Now we can add this clipping plane to our object, meaning this object
will be clipped by the plane .&nbsp; MAKE cross the current object for
the next section, either by selecting in the ViewerGUI or by clicking on
it in the camera. (HINT: you may want to increase the size of "cross" with
Shift-Middle Mouse Button before starting this section)
<pre>>>> cross.AddClipPlane(cl)</pre>
To activate and display this plane,&nbsp; select the Clip button in the
Properties Panel.&nbsp; This will show the Clip Properties submenu.&nbsp;
Click on row 1 button under on heading. This makes this clipping plane
interact with the current object, cross.&nbsp; To display the clipping
plane, click on row 1 button under the disp. (display)&nbsp; heading.&nbsp;
Notice that as you translate the square, it gets clipped when it moves
into the left half of the camera.&nbsp; If you toggle the button in row
1 under the side heading, this will change.&nbsp; You can add other clipping
planes using this submenu.&nbsp; First, be sure that ~MyFirstObject is
the current object.&nbsp; Then clipping planes are made to slice it by
turning on the buttons in the first column.&nbsp; The side buttons toggle
which part of the clipped object is displayed.
<pre>#Make the clipping plane visible
>>> cl.Set(visible=1)</pre>
<tt># translate it to the right</tt>
<br><tt>>>> cl.ConcatTranslation( (0.5, 0., 0.) )</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="example1.jpg" height=449 width=433 align=LEFT>
<p>When you bind clipping planes to an object, you can specify whether
or not it should clip this object's children using the inh buttons.
<p>We can now <b>transform the clipping</b> plane either by picking on
it (left mouse button) or by selection (Transform Clip) in the GUI.
<br>As you rotate the plane you will see that is is actually a square with
diagonals. Translations are always done perpendicular to the clipping plane.
Scale only changes the geometry representing the clipping plane which is
infinite .&nbsp; Of course, the plane can be made invisible by toggling
the disp button. The reset button in the GUI will reset the clipping plane's
transformation if the Clip button under Transform is on.
<p>Note that when you move the "<b><i>root</i></b>" object or the "<b><i>~MyFirstObject</i></b>"
object, the clipping plane doesn't move. this is because it doesn't inherit
transformations. If you want to look at how it clips your geometry from
somewhere else you'll have to <b>transform the camera's position</b>. You
can do this either by double clicking (left mouse button) on the camera's
background or by selecting "Transform Camera" in the GUI.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="60%" BGCOLOR="#FFCCCC" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td>Double Left-button</td>

<td NOSAVE>transform camera</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
&nbsp;Now when you rotate the relative position of the plane, the object
doesn't change. You look at it from somewhere else.
