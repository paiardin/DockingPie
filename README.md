![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68196372/158363199-aaaabe39-ce47-4a3e-b794-e57e088c2cce.png)

**DockingPie** is a plugin of the popular molecular graphics system PyMOL [1] that offers a versatile and user-friendly graphical user interface for assisting molecular and consensus docking analyses. 

At the current, and first release, the implemented docking programs are **Smina**, **Autodock Vina**, **RxDock** and **ADFR** [2-5]. 

Providing an easy interface to four docking programs, DockingPie is particularly suited as a platform to carry out **consensus docking and scoring analyses**.


## NEWS 

26 November 2022 - Release of DockingPie 1.2.1

- Fixed inaccessible configuration resources from GitHub (GitHub censorship)
- Now compatible with Vina 1.2.3 


## Known Issue 

"Check for updates" functionality in the CONFIGURATION TAB is currently out of use.

## Requirements

**Minimal requirement**: a recent version of PyMOL installed on your computer. 

DockingPie is compatible with incentive PyMOL builds distributed by [Schrodinger](https://pymol.org/2/ "Schrodinger website") (required PyMOL version >= 2.3.4) and open source builds (required PyMOL version >= 2.3.0).

DockingPie is distributed freely to the public and it has been tested and runs on Windows, macOS and Linux versions of PyMOL.


(Some incompatibilities may arise with the usage of PyMOL version 2.5.x if ‘undo’ function is enabled, which in PyMOL 2.5.2 still shows some shortcomings. Therefore, when the plugin is opened, the ‘undo’ function is automatically disabled and it is strongly suggested to keep it disabled when using the plugin.)


## Download

DockingPie plugin ZIP file: [download from here](https://github.com/paiardin/DockingPie/archive/refs/heads/main.zip "DockingPie plugin ZIP file direct download") 


## Installation 
    
DockingPie is installed, as any other PyMOL [1] plugin, via the PyMOL plugin manager:

* First download the latest version of the plugin ZIP file [here](https://github.com/paiardin/DockingPie/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  "DockingPie plugin ZIP file direct download") 

* Launch PyMOL and use the *Plugin* → *Plugin Manager* command from the main menu of PyMOL. The plugin manager window of PyMOL will open.

* Click on *Install New Plugin* and press the *Choose File…* button. Select the **DockingPie ZIP file** which you have downloaded before. 
You will be asked to give the path of the directory in which to install the plugin files. Just select the default option if you are unsure about what to do (the location of the plugin files does not make any difference when running the plugin).

## Configuration 

DockingPie, at the current and first release, integrates four different docking programs: RxDock [2], Vina [3], Smina [4] and ADFR [5]; several chemo-informatics python modules (i.e. AutoDockTools [6], Openbabel [7], sPyRMSD [8]) and other external tools like sdsorter [9]. The CONFIGURATION tab provides an easy way for the installation of the needed tools from within the plugin in two steps, as reported next.

* Configure external tools: CONFIGURATION tab → *Configure* → *Start Download* → *Finish Download*

* Install external tools: If the needed tools are not currently installed on the user’s machine, the *Install* button is enabled and it can be used to install the external components.

## DockingPie in open-source PyMOL version

DockingPie is fully compatible with open-source PyMOL version. 
However, since the “Conda Package Manager” is not integrated in open-source PyMOL, the automatic installation of the dependencies is not fully supported from within DockingPie. Thought that RxDock, sPyRMSD and OpenBabel would be manually installed by the User, we have added a section in the [User's Guide](https://github.com/paiardin/DockingPie/releases/download/versioning/DockingPie_User_Guide.pdf "DockingPie User's guide") (section 2.3) to help handling DockingPie and its dependencies on open-source PyMOL.
